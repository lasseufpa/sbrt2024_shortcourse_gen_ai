The code consists of a RAG system that retrieves context from the rel18 documents of the 3GPP Standart combined with a query enhancement process that extracts the terms, definitions, and abbreviations of the question and appends their meanings to the context as well as a LLM model that was finetuned from phi-2 with the context data to improve it`s utilization of the context.
